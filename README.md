# Data Science Lab Exam

This repository contains the notebook I created to pass the exam of Data Science Lab in year 2023 at Polytechnic Univerisity of Turin. The project consisted in audio recordings classification for understanding virtual assistant commands. The core of my project consisted in exploiting a powerful feature extraction from audio signals comprehending both time domain and frequency domain features. The code is well organized and the experiment is reproducible by running the notebook.
